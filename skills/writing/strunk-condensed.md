# Elements of Style — Composition Principles

Condensed from William Strunk Jr.'s 1918 text. One principle + best example per rule.

---

### 8. One paragraph per topic
Each paragraph = one idea. Beginning signals a new step to the reader. Single sentences should not stand as paragraphs.

### 9. Topic sentence first
(a) Topic sentence at the beginning, (b) middle sentences develop it, (c) final sentence emphasizes or states consequence. Never end with a digression.

### 10. Active voice

| Passive/Weak | Active/Strong |
|---|---|
| There were dead leaves lying on the ground. | Dead leaves covered the ground. |
| The sound of a guitar could be heard. | Somewhere in the house a guitar hummed sleepily. |
| It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what he had. | He soon repented his words. |
| A survey of this region was made in 1900. | This region was surveyed in 1900. |

Active voice is more direct, bold, and concise. Don't discard passive entirely — use it when the receiver of action is the topic.

### 11. Positive form

| Negative/Evasive | Positive/Direct |
|---|---|
| He was not very often on time. | He usually came late. |
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not pay attention to | ignored |
| not important | trifling |
| did not have much confidence in | distrusted |

Use *not* for denial or antithesis ("Not charity, but simple justice"), never as evasion.

### 12. Specific, concrete language

| Vague | Concrete |
|---|---|
| A period of unfavorable weather set in. | It rained every day for a week. |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward. | He grinned as he pocketed the coin. |

The surest way to hold attention is being specific, definite, and concrete.

### 13. Omit needless words

Every word must tell. Common offenders:

| Wordy | Concise |
|---|---|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | doubtless |
| owing to the fact that | since |
| in spite of the fact that | although |
| he is a man who | he |
| the fact that I had arrived | my arrival |
| the fact that | cut or rephrase |
| in order to | to |
| for the purpose of | to, for |
| in the event that | if |
| at this point in time | now |
| due to the fact that | because |
| in terms of | cut or be specific |
| with regard to | about |

Combine fragmented ideas:
- **51 words**: "Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true..."
- **26 words**: "Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place."

### 14. Vary sentence structure
Don't chain clause after clause with *and*, *but*, *so*, *which*. A whole paragraph of this structure becomes monotonous. Recast into simple sentences, semicolons, or periodic sentences.

### 15. Parallel construction

| Broken Parallel | Parallel |
|---|---|
| Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed. | Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method. |
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. | The ceremony was both long and tedious. |

Correlatives (both/and, not/but, either/or) must be followed by the same grammatical form.

### 16. Keep related words together

| Scattered | Gathered |
|---|---|
| He only found two mistakes. | He found only two mistakes. |
| All the members were not present. | Not all the members were present. |
| Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church. | In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church. |

Subject and verb close together. Modifier next to what it modifies. Relative pronoun immediately after its antecedent.

### 17. One tense in summaries
Pick present or past, then hold it throughout. Shifting tenses signals uncertainty.

### 18. Emphatic words at end

| Buried Emphasis | End Emphasis |
|---|---|
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. | Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. |
| This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness. | Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors. |

The beginning of a sentence is the second most emphatic position. The end is first.
