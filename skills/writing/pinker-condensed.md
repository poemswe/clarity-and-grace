# The Sense of Style — Condensed

From Steven Pinker's text. One principle + ban list per rule.

---

### 1. No meta-commentary

The writing is a window. Never narrate the act of writing, reading, or discussing.

| Ban | Why |
|---|---|
| "in this post" | The reader already knows they're reading your post. |
| "in this article" | Same. |
| "as mentioned earlier" | If you need to repeat something, repeat it. |
| "it should be noted that" | Just state the thing. |
| "it is worth mentioning" | If it's worth mentioning, mention it. |
| "let me explain" | Just explain. |

### 2. No hedging

Commit to claims or present evidence. Hedging signals low confidence and hides your voice.

| Ban | Why |
|---|---|
| "it seems like" | Commit or present evidence. |
| "arguably" | Make the argument or don't. |
| "it could be said that" | Say it or don't. |

### 3. Curse of knowledge

You know things your reader does not. Before every paragraph, ask what the reader already knows. Start there.

- Introduce one new concept at a time.
- Define terms through context on first use, not parenthetical definitions.
- If a sentence forces the reader to track more than four new items, break it apart.

### 4. Classic prose stance

Write as if you see something clearly and are pointing it out to an equal. The motive is truth, not persuasion. The tone is conversational. The reader is competent.

- Never talk down, hedge, or over-qualify.
- Never draw attention to the writing itself.
- Place related ideas next to each other and let the reader see the connection. Never announce it with "similarly," "this mirrors," or "this is just like."
