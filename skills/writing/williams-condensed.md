### 1. Characters as subjects

Every sentence tells a story. Make the main character in that story the grammatical subject. A character can be a person, an abstraction, a concept, or a process.

| Characters buried | Characters as subjects |
|---|---|
| That students retained more information when classroom activities involved student-directed inquiry was one of the key facts revealed by the analysis. | The analysis revealed that students retained more information when classroom activities involved student-directed inquiry. |
| An extension of their study of memory was conducted by Horowitz and Dunnigan. | Horowitz and Dunnigan extended their study of memory. |
| There is a need for further investigation by the team. | The team needs to investigate further. |

The first example buries the character ("analysis") inside a long noun phrase and uses a linking verb ("was"). The revision makes the character the subject and gives it an action ("revealed"). The structure "character X does action Y" works whether the character is a person or an abstraction.

Find the real agent. Ask: "Who or what is doing something in this sentence?" Make that agent the subject.

### 2. Actions as verbs

Put actions in verb form. Avoid hiding them inside nouns (nominalizations).

Nominalizations are nouns formed from verbs (calibrate→calibration, decide→decision), adjectives (pompous→pomposity), or other nouns (crony→cronyism). They turn actions and qualities into abstract things, making sentences harder to parse.

| Action hidden in noun | Action as verb |
|---|---|
| The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency toward pomposity and abstraction. | Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract. |
| The mass spectrometer managed the measurement and identification of the proteins. | The mass spectrometer measured and identified the proteins. |
| Our lack of data prevented us from making the prediction about the outcome. | Because we lacked data we could not predict the outcome. |
| The intention of the committee is to improve morale. | The committee intends to improve morale. |

Diagnostic: look for nouns ending in -tion, -ment, -ence, -ance, -ity, -ism, -ness. Ask whether the noun was once a verb or adjective. If yes, turn it back.

**Exception:** Keep nominalizations that are the established term for a concept. "Alienation" in Marx, "phyletic gradualism" in evolutionary biology, "nominalization" in linguistics. If the noun IS the topic, use it. The rule targets unnecessary nominalizations, not necessary ones.

### 3. Old before new

Readers expect sentences to start with familiar ("old") ideas and end with unfamiliar ("new") ideas. Disrupting this flow confuses readers.

**Disorienting (new before old):**
> Once upon a time there were three little pigs. Scrappy, Sparky, and Spanky were their names. Bricklaying is a difficult job, but Scrappy was very good at it. Poetry is totally different from bricklaying, and poetry was Sparky's passion.

Each sentence after the first opens with something the reader has never seen. "Scrappy" appears before the reader knows it's a pig's name. "Bricklaying" appears from nowhere.

**Clear (old before new):**
> Once upon a time there were three little pigs. The pigs' names were Scrappy, Sparky, and Spanky. Scrappy was a bricklayer. Bricklaying is a difficult job, but Scrappy was very good at it.

Each sentence starts by gesturing back at something already mentioned (old info), then introduces new information at the end. "The pigs" refers back to "three little pigs." "Scrappy" refers back to the name just introduced. "Bricklaying" refers back to "bricklayer."

The end of a sentence is its stress position. Readers naturally give the most weight to whatever lands there. Place your most important point at the end.

### 4. Topic strings

A cohesive paragraph keeps the same topic (subject) across consecutive sentences. Erratic topic changes force readers to re-orient with every sentence.

| Shifting topics | Consistent topic string |
|---|---|
| The primary cause was a lack of funding. Researchers had already identified the mechanism. Publication of the results was delayed. | The research team identified the mechanism early. They lacked funding to continue. They delayed publication. |

Run your eye down the subjects of consecutive sentences. If every sentence starts with a different subject, the paragraph will feel scattered.

### 5. Stress position

End sentences with the information you want readers to remember. The stress position is the last few words before the period.

| Emphasis buried | Emphasis at end |
|---|---|
| The ability to understand the context of a patient's symptoms is one of the most important skills a doctor can develop. | One of the most important skills a doctor can develop is understanding the context of a patient's symptoms. |

When introducing a technical term, design the sentence so the term lands at the end, never at the beginning.

Never end a sentence on placeholder nouns: something, things, stuff, aspects, factors. Never end on vague pronouns: it, this, that. The stress position demands your most concrete, most specific word.

### 6. Subject-verb proximity

Keep the main character close to its action. When too many words separate subject from verb, the reader must hold all that information in short-term memory while waiting for the payoff.

**Subject and verb separated (hard):**
> The big fish, although not, at the moment, hungry, as a result of having eaten a whole school of smaller fish less than an hour before, but feeling it within his nature to devour another fish simply to prove a point to onlookers, ate the little fish.

**Subject and verb together (clear):**
> The big fish ate the little fish, even though he was not hungry after having eaten a whole school of smaller fish less than an hour before.

The revision puts "big fish ate" together at the start. All the qualifying information trails after, where readers can absorb it incrementally. Put the main clause first. Let subordinate detail follow.

### 7. Concision

Cut words that add no meaning.

| Wordy | Concise |
|---|---|
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |
| at this point in time | now |
| has the ability to | can |
| it is possible that | perhaps / may |
| on a daily basis | daily |
| a large number of | many |
| in order to | to |
| full and complete | complete |

Also cut: kind of, really, basically, actually, virtually, in a sense, certain, particular, individual, given.

### 8. Coherence

Cohesion links sentence to sentence. Coherence organizes the whole paragraph around a single point.

A coherent paragraph:
(a) States or implies its point in the first one or two sentences.
(b) Makes every following sentence advance that point.
(c) Introduces each new concept at the end of its first sentence, then uses it as old information in the next.

If you can delete a sentence without damaging the paragraph's argument, that sentence does not belong.

### 9. Write for the reader, not for your thinking

You write to think. Your reader does not care about your thinking process. Once you have written to think, go back and rewrite for the reader's benefit.

This requires empathy. Ask: What does my reader already know? What must I explain? What order prevents confusion? What are the likely sources of misunderstanding?

The stuff you write to work through your own ideas is almost never useful to the reader in its original form. Revision is not polishing. Revision is reorganizing your text around what the reader needs, not what you needed to figure out.

### 10. Elegance

Elegance comes from balance and rhythm.

- Use parallel construction for coordinate ideas.
- Vary sentence length. Follow a long sentence with a short one. Diagnostic: count words per sentence. Three consecutive sentences within 2 words of each other creates monotony. Vary by at least 3.
- Read aloud. If you stumble, the reader will too.
- End on strength. The last word of a sentence, the last sentence of a paragraph, and the last paragraph of a document all carry disproportionate weight.
